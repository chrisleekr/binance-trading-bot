-This is a test project. I am just testing my code.
-
-## Warnings
-
-**I cannot guarantee whether you can make money or not.**
-
-**So use it at your own risk! I have no responsibility for any loss or hardship
-incurred directly or indirectly by using this code. Read
-[disclaimer](#disclaimer) before using this code.**
-
-**Before updating the bot, make sure to record the last buy price in the note. It may lose the configuration or last buy price records.**
-
-## How it works
-
-### Trailing Grid Trade Buy/Sell Bot
-
-This bot is using the concept of trailing buy/sell order which allows following the price fall/rise.
-
-> Trailing Stop Orders
-> About Trailing Stop Orders Concept you can find at [Binance Official document](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/360042299292)
->
-> TL;DR
-> Place orders at a fixed value or percentage when the price changes. Using this feature you can buy at the lowest possible price when buying down and sell at the highest possible price when selling up.
-
-- The bot supports multiple buy/sell orders based on the configuration.
-- The bot can monitor multiple symbols. All symbols will be monitored per second.
-- The bot is using MongoDB to provide a persistence database. However, it does not use the latest MongoDB to support Raspberry Pi 32bit. Used MongoDB version
-  is 3.2.20, which is provided by [apcheamitru](https://hub.docker.com/r/apcheamitru/arm32v7-mongo).
-- The bot is tested/working with Linux and Raspberry Pi 4 32bit. Other platforms are not tested.
-
-#### Buy Signal
-
-The bot will continuously monitor the coin based on the grid trade configuration.
-
-For grid trade #1, the bot will place a STOP-LOSS-LIMIT order to buy when the current price reaches the lowest price. If the current price continuously falls, then the bot will cancel the previous order and re-place the new STOP-LOSS-LIMIT order with the new price.
-
-After grid trade #1, the bot will monitor the COIN based on the last buy price.
-
-- The bot will not place a buy order of the grid trade #1 if has enough coin (typically over $10 worth) to sell when reaches the trigger price for selling.
-- The bot will remove the last buy price if the estimated value is less than the last buy price removal threshold.
-
-##### Buy Scenario
-
-Let say, if the buy grid trade configurations are set as below:
-
-- Number of grids: 2
-- Grids
-  | No# | Trigger Percentage  | Stop Price Percentage | Limit price percentage | USDT |
-  | --- | ------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- | ---- |
-  | 1   | 1                   | 1.05                  | 1.051                  | 50   |
-  | 2   | 0.8                 | 1.03                  | 1.031                  | 100  |
-
-To make it easier to understand, I will use `$` as a USDT symbol. For the simple calculation, I do not take an account for the commission. In real trading, the quantity may be different.
-
-Your 1st grid trading for buying is configured as below:
-
-- Grid No#: 1
-- Trigger percentage: 1
-- Stop percentage: 1.05 (5.00%)
-- Limit percentage: 1.051 (5.10%)
-- Max purchase amount: $50
-
-And the market is as below:
-
-- Current price: $105
-- Lowest price: $100
-- Trigger price: $100
-
-When the current price is falling to the lowest price ($100) and lower than ATH(All-Time High) restricted price if enabled, the bot will place new STOP-LOSS-LIMIT order for buying.
-
-- Stop price: $100 * 1.05 = $105
-- Limit price: $100 * 1.051 = $105.1
-- Quantity: 0.47573
-
-Let's assume the market changes as below:
-
-- Current price: $95
-
-Then the bot will follow the price fall and place new STOP-LOSS-LIMIT order as below:
-
-- Stop price: $95 * 1.05 = $99.75
-- Limit price: $95 * 1.051 = $99.845
-- Quantity: 0.5
-
-Let's assume the market changes as below:
-
-- Current price: $100
-
-Then the bot will execute 1st purchase for the coin. The last buy price will be recorded as `$99.845`. The purchased quantity will be `0.5`.
-
-Once the coin is purchased, the bot will start monitoring the sell signal and at the same time, monitor the next grid trading for buying.
-
-Your 2nd grid trading for buying is configured as below:
-
-- Grid#: 2
-- Current last buy price: $99.845
-- Trigger percentage: 0.8 (20%)
-- Stop percentage: 1.03 (3.00%)
-- Limit percentage: 1.031 (3.10%)
-- Max purchase amount: $100
-
-And if the current price is continuously falling to `$79.876` (20% lower), then the bot will place new STOP-LOSS-LIMIT order for the 2nd grid trading for the coin.
-
-Let's assume the market changes as below:
-
-- Current price: $75
-
-Then the bot will follow the price fall and place new STOP-LOSS-LIMT order as below:
-
-- Stop price: $75 * 1.03 = $77.25
-- Limit price: $75 * 1.031 = $77.325
-- Quantity: 1.29
-
-Let's assume the market changes as below:
-
-- Current price: $78
-
-Then the bot will execute 2nd purchase for the coin. The last buy price will be automatically re-calculated as below:
-
-- Final last buy price: ($50 + $100)/(0.5 COIN + 1.29 COIN) = $83.80
-
-##### In-depth Buy Configuration in-depth
-
-The detailed document for buy configuration available here.
-
-[https://github.com/chrisleekr/binance-trading-bot/wiki/Buy-Scenario](https://github.com/chrisleekr/binance-trading-bot/wiki/Buy-Scenario)
-
-### Sell Signal
-
-If there is enough balance for selling and the last buy price is recorded in the bot, then the bot will start monitoring the sell signal of the grid trade #1. Once the current price reaches the trigger price of the grid trade #1, then the bot will place a STOP-LOSS-LIMIT order to sell. If the current price continuously rises, then the bot will cancel the previous order and re-place the new STOP-LOSS-LIMIT order with the new price.
-
-- If the bot does not have a record for the last buy price, the bot will not sell the coin.
-- If the coin is worth less than the last buy price removal threshold, then the bot will remove the last buy price.
-- If the coin is not worth than the minimum notional value, then the bot will not place an order.
-
-#### Sell Scenario
-
-Let say, if the sell grid trade configurations are set as below:
-
-- Number of grids: 2
-- Grids
-  | No# | Trigger Percentage  | Stop Price Percentage | Limit price percentage | Sell Quantity Percentage |
-  | --- | ------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- |------------------------- |
-  | 1st | 1.05                | 0.97                  | 0.969                  | 0.5                      |
-  | 2nd | 1.08                | 0.95                  | 0.949                  | 1                        |
-
-Unlike buy, the sell configuration will use the percentage of a quantity. If you want to sell all of your coin quantity, then simply configure it as `1` (100%).
-
-From the last buy actions, you now have the following balances:
-
-- Current quantity: 1.79
-- Current last buy price: $83.80
-
-Your 1st grid trading for selling is configured as below:
-
-- Grid No# 1
-- Trigger percentage: 1.05
-- Stop price percentage: 0.97
-- Limit price percentage: 0.969
-- Sell amount percentage: 0.5
-
-Let's assume the market changes as below:
-
-- Current price: $88
-
-As the current price is higher than the sell trigger price($87.99), then the bot will place new STOP-LOSS-LIMIT order for selling.
-
-- Stop price: $88 * 0.97 = $85.36
-- Limit price: $88 * 0.969 = $85.272
-- Quantity: 0.895
-
-Let's assume the market changes as below:
-
-- Current price: $90
-
-Then the bot will follow the price rise and place new STOP-LOSS-LIMIT order as below:
-
-- Stop price: $90 * 0.97 = $87.30
-- Limit price: $90 * 0.969 = $87.21
-- Quantity: 0.895
-
-Let's assume the market changes as below:
-
-- Current price: $87
-
-Then the bot will execute 1st sell for the coin. Then the bot will now wait for 2nd selling trigger price ($83.80 * 1.08 = $90.504).
-
-- Current quantity: 0.895
-- Current last buy price: $83.80
-
-Let's assume the market changes as below:
-
-- Current price: $91
-
-Then the current price($91) is higher than 2nd selling trigger price ($90.504), the bot will place new STOP-LOSS-LIMIT order as below:
-
-- Stop price: $91 * 0.95 = $86.45
-- Limit price: $91 * 0.949 = $86.359
-- Quantity: 0.895
-
-Let's assume the market changes as below:
-
-- Current price: $100
-
-Then the bot will follow the price rise and place new STOP-LOSS-LIMT order as below:
-
-- Stop price: $100 * 0.95 = $95
-- Limit price: $100 * 0.949 = $94.9
-- Quantity: 0.895
-
-Let's assume the market changes as below:
-
-- Current price: $94
-
-Then the bot will execute 2nd sell for the coin.
-
-The final profit would be
-
-- 1st sell: $94.9 * 0.895 = $84.9355
-- 2nd sell: $87.21 * 0.895 = $78.05295
-- Final profit: $162 (8% profit)

-
-2. Launch/Update the bot with docker-compose
-
-   Pull latest code first:

-   ```bash
-   docker-compose -f docker-compose.server.yml pull
-   docker-compose -f docker-compose.server.yml up -d
-   ```
-
-   Or if want development/test mode, then run below commands:
-
-   ```bash
-   docker-compose up -d --build
-   ```
-
-3. Open browser `http://0.0.0.0:8080` to see the frontend
-
-   - When launching the application, it will notify public URL to the Slack.
-   - If you have any issue with the bot, you can check the log to find out what happened with the bot. Please take a look [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/chrisleekr/binance-trading-bot/wiki/Troubleshooting)
